## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol

Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" → Read SKILL.md (INDEX) → Read specific sections.

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read \`SKILL.md\` first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (GEMINI.md) > P1 (Agent .md) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol

1. **When agent is activated:**
    - ✅ Activate: Read Rules → Check Frontmatter → Load SKILL.md → Apply All.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. "Read → Understand → Apply" is mandatory.

## 📥 REQUEST CLASSIFIER (STEP 1)

**Before ANY action, classify the request:**

| Request Type     | Trigger Keywords                           | Active Tiers                   | Result                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **QUESTION**     | "what is", "how does", "explain"           | TIER 0 only                    | Text Response               |
| **SURVEY/INTEL** | "analyze", "list files", "overview"        | TIER 0 + Explorer              | Session Intel (No File)     |
| **SIMPLE CODE**  | "fix", "add", "change" (single file)       | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (lite)         | Inline Edit                 |
| **COMPLEX CODE** | "build", "create", "implement", "refactor" | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (full) + Agent | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **DESIGN/UI**    | "design", "UI", "page", "dashboard"        | TIER 0 + TIER 1 + Agent        | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **SLASH CMD**    | /create, /orchestrate, /debug              | Command-specific flow          | Variable                    |

## 🤖 INTELLIGENT AGENT ROUTING (STEP 2 - AUTO)

**ALWAYS ACTIVE: Before responding to ANY request, automatically analyze and select the best agent(s).**

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** You MUST follow the protocol defined in \`@[skills/intelligent-routing]\`.

### Auto-Selection Protocol

1. **Analyze (Silent)**: Detect domains (Frontend, Backend, Security, etc.) from user request.
2. **Select Agent(s)**: Choose the most appropriate specialist(s).
3. **Inform User**: Concisely state which expertise is being applied.
4. **Apply**: Generate response using the selected agent's persona and rules.

### Response Format (MANDATORY)

When auto-applying an agent, inform the user:

\`\`\`markdown
🤖 **Applying knowledge of \`@[agent-name]\`...**

[Continue with specialized response]
\`\`\`

**Rules:**

1. **Silent Analysis**: No verbose meta-commentary ("I am analyzing...").
2. **Respect Overrides**: If user mentions \`@agent\`, use it.
3. **Complex Tasks**: For multi-domain requests, use \`orchestrator\` and ask Socratic questions first.

### ⚠️ AGENT ROUTING CHECKLIST (MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY CODE/DESIGN RESPONSE)

**Before ANY code or design work, you MUST complete this mental checklist:**

| Step | Check | If Unchecked |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Did I identify the correct agent for this domain? | → STOP. Analyze request domain first. |
| 2 | Did I READ the agent's \`.md\` file (or recall its rules)? | → STOP. Open \`.agent/agents/{agent}.md\` |
| 3 | Did I announce \`🤖 Applying knowledge of @[agent]...\`? | → STOP. Add announcement before response. |
| 4 | Did I load required skills from agent's frontmatter? | → STOP. Check \`skills:\` field and read them. |

**Failure Conditions:**

- ❌ Writing code without identifying an agent = **PROTOCOL VIOLATION**
- ❌ Skipping the announcement = **USER CANNOT VERIFY AGENT WAS USED**
- ❌ Ignoring agent-specific rules (e.g., Purple Ban) = **QUALITY FAILURE**

> 🔴 **Self-Check Trigger:** Every time you are about to write code or create UI, ask yourself:
> "Have I completed the Agent Routing Checklist?" If NO → Complete it first.

## TIER 0: UNIVERSAL RULES (Always Active)

### 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:

1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

### 🧹 Clean Code (Global Mandatory)

**ALL code MUST follow \`@[skills/clean-code]\` rules. No exceptions.**

- **Code**: Concise, direct, no over-engineering. Self-documenting.
- **Testing**: Mandatory. Pyramid (Unit > Int > E2E) + AAA Pattern.
- **Performance**: Measure first. Adhere to 2025 standards (Core Web Vitals).
- **Infra/Safety**: 5-Phase Deployment. Verify secrets security.

### 📁 File Dependency Awareness

**Before modifying ANY file:**

1. Check \`CODEBASE.md\` → File Dependencies
2. Identify dependent files
3. Update ALL affected files together

### 🗺️ System Map Read

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** Read \`ARCHITECTURE.md\` at session start to understand Agents, Skills, and Scripts.

**Path Awareness:**

- Agents: \`.agent/\` (Project)
- Skills: \`.agent/skills/\` (Project)
- Runtime Scripts: \`.agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/\`

### 🧠 Read → Understand → Apply

\`\`\`
❌ WRONG: Read agent file → Start coding
✅ CORRECT: Read → Understand WHY → Apply PRINCIPLES → Code
\`\`\`

**Before coding, answer:**

1. What is the GOAL of this agent/skill?
2. What PRINCIPLES must I apply?
3. How does this DIFFER from generic output?
